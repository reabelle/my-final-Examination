Through GitHub, you can share your code with others, giving them the power to make revisions or edits on your various Git branches. This makes it possible for entire teams to coordinate together on single projects in real-time. As changes are introduced, new branches are created, allowing the team to continue to revise the code without overwriting each other's work. These branches are like copies, and changes made on them do not reflect in the main directories on other usersâ€™ machines unless users choose to push/pull the changes to incorporate them. There is also a GitHub desktop application available, which offers some additional functionality for experienced developers.r
